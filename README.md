# contact

# Instructions to test the API
I am using SQLLite as database repository. 
Navigate to the ContactAPI folder.
Perform a command dotnet ef database update
then a command dotnet run.
Then you can test the API to insert contact, select contact, and select by Id.

I didn't have the time to implement the testing or the delete, update of the contact.
